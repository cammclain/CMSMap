# CMSMap



## CMS Map, cmsmap, cmsMap. Whatever the fuck I decide to call it. What is it?

`cmsmap`, (my favorite way to type it), is just a project I work on when I am too high to work on other stuff. 

I'm half joking, but not really. Expect dog shit code, and delusional documentation. idgaf lol.


## Why am I making this?

Fun. Kinda. And learning more about CMSs like Wordpress, and Woocommerce to exploit them.

### Why would you want to do that???
If you don't I think you're the weird one here.



Ok seriously what are we doing here??


We are developing a system, kinda like Metasploit, but for CMS based sites. Just CMS based sites. specifically wordpress.
